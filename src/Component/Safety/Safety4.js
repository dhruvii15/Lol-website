                <p>LOL is meant to be a place that is fun and safe for all, where users can be their authentic selves and deepen their connections with their real-world friends in an online space. The LOL team has developed a complex safety system and a dedicated Community Team that work day and night to keep you, our users, safe. We’ve even added a variety of safety controls that allow users to enhance the security of their inboxes in unique ways:</p>
            </div>
            <div className='pt-5 ps-4'>
                <p className='BwGradualBold fs-2'>1. Hidden words</p>
                <p>The “Hidden words” safety control allows users to hide messages that they don’t want to see in their inbox by creating a custom list of words, emojis, and phrases that will automatically be filtered out from all future messages. This allows users to precisely determine what messages they want to allow into their inbox, down to the word and even to the emoji!</p>
            </div>

            <div className='pt-5 ps-4'>
                <p className='BwGradualBold fs-2'>2. Blocked users</p>
                <p>This safety setting displays a list of individuals blocked by the LOL user, allowing the user to have an overview of everyone that they have blocked and permitting them to unblock individuals at any time. This provides LOL users an increased level of control over the security of their inbox.</p>
            </div>

            <div className='pt-5 ps-4'>
                <p className='BwGradualBold fs-2'>3. Pause my link</p>
                <p>This feature allows LOL users to pause their LOL link, meaning that they can stop receiving messages in their LOL inbox for their chosen period of time. If a user becomes overwhelmed by their volume of incoming messages, they can pause their link for as long as they’d like, waiting to resume receiving messages until they’re once again ready to use LOL. Currently, users can choose to pause for preset times of 1, 6, or 24 hours, or they can choose to pause their link indefinitely and can unpause whenever they’re comfortable.</p>
            </div>

            <div className='pt-5 ps-4'>
                <p className='BwGradualBold fs-2'>4. Enhanced moderation</p>
                <p>Users who turn on the enhanced moderation safety control will have even more messages that meet LOL’s moderation criteria automatically filtered out, so these messages never appear in users' inboxes.</p>
                <p>Taken together, these safety controls allow LOL users to manage the kind of content they see in their inboxes, who can send them messages, and when they can receive messages. In tandem, they provide another layer of security to protect our LOL community.</p>
